#####ecdf.R
  - **Code Functionality**
    - It had trouble opening the 250.csv file but once I figured that out, the code ran smoothly
  - **What to Improve**
    - The plots need an x axis label
    - Does the x-axis represent 100 year intervals? If so, what is the starting year?
    - The x-axis should be shifted so that it starts at 0 instead of -100

#####etas-training.R
  - **Code Functionality**
    - I had to make sure to have the right file name for "socal.txt" and "VS-functions.R" before I could run the code but once I did, the code ran smoothly. 
  - **What to Improve**
      - Better documentation about what csv files you have to download to your computer before running the code. Is there a way to quickly download all the necessary csv files?
      - The graph is already pretty informative and easy to read. Maybe important k-values could be indicated on the graph.
      - For the graph to be descriptive on its own, I think the x and y labels should specify in words what v and t stand for. 

#####mda_test.r
  - **Code Functionality**
    - runs smoothly but slow
  - **What to Improve**
    - The graphs already look pretty good but I think it would be difficult for someone to understand what the graphs are trying to show without more information
    - What do the different colors represent in the "Area under Error Diagram" plot?
    - It's a little hard to distinguish the colors in the "Error Diagrams of the Models" plot
    - The "Training set error diagrams" plot does not have a legend
    - A better x-label for the "Area under Error Diagram" plot if possible
    - If there are any interesting/informative points on the graphs, it would be helpful if they were indicated
      -k values, outliers, etc. 

#####Quakers-MDAtest250.R
  - **Code Functionality**
    - I got an error at first because I had to install.packages("sfsmisc")
    - otherwise, code runs smoothly
  - **What to Improve**
    - The second graph that is plotted doesn't have any titles and I'm not sure what it is trying to show. A legend needs to be added
    - A legend needs to be added to the "Training Set error Diagrams" plot

#####Quakers-EarthquakeSuccessors.R
  - **Code Functionality**
    - I had a little trouble downloading the DataFrame but once I did, the code ran smoothly  
  - **What to Improve**
    - The graphs are colorful and contain a lot of data
    - I am having a little trouble figuring out what the graph is showing. 
    - The legend is just numbers 1-5. I'm not sure what these numbers correspond to.
