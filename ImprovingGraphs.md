  - **Code Functionality**
    - It had trouble opening the 250.csv file but once I figured that out, the code ran smoothly
  - **What to Improve**
    - The graphs need an x axis label
    - It is difficult to determine whether the x-axis is divided into 100 year intervals
    - If the x-axis represents years, the starting year should be indicated because right now there are negative values.
