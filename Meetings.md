###Class: November 19, 2013

- **New Group Members added**
  - Qi Zhang
  - Kuanwei Tang

- **Discuss Goals for the week**
  - Plan on reading Quakers gitHUb repository and understanding their code
  - Go to office hours this weekend and talk to Aaron about our next steps.
  - Make a Google Calendar so we can coordinate meeting times since our group now consists of 9 members
  - Jie, Alisha, Kuanwei, and Hyungkyu are planning on looking at other visualizer group's code and seeing how we can improve the existing graphs.
  - Qi and Christina have some programming experience so they will write the code to modify the graphs. 



###Meeting: November 16, 2013

- **Met at Cafe Milano at 4 pm**
  - Jie Zhang
  - Alisha Agrawal
  - Christina Ho
  - JinSoo Lee
  - Sung Hoon Choi
    - *Update* Hyungkyu Chang excused
- **Discuss SMART Groups**
- **Fill in Google Spreadsheet**

- **S.M.A.R.T. Goals for Week of November 18-23**
  - [**S**] Specific:
    - Read Luen Paper in depth
    - Talk to other analyzer and visualizer groups and decide with them what model has not been assigned yet
  - [**M**] Measurable:
    - Jinsoo + Sung is going to be in charge of reading the paper and summarizing the main points with the rest of the group.
    - Alisha and Jie will be in charge of keeping in touch with the other groups, primarily our analyzer/curator groups. He will be in charge of coordinating a meeting with the analyzers.
  - [**A**] Attainable:
    - We are breaking up the tasks into smaller parts so everyone in the group is making a contribution
  - [**R**] Relevant: 
    - Visualizers we need data from the analyzers to create graphs
    - We need to understand the Luen paper to create meaningful graphs
    - Need to make sure that we are not working on the same model as other groups
  - [**T**] Time-Bound:
    - These are small goals so we could complete them within a week
    - We are contacting other visualizers and analyzers today
    - We will coordinate a meeting with them and possible Aaron this week

###Meeting: Novemeber 9, 2013

**Overall Task - 8** - **Create Visual for ETAS and Alarm Data in Report** 
  - Understand the parameters of the model
  - What are our axes
  - PDF versus CDF
  - Create graph output for the coordinate data we receive from the analyzers - output the two graphs on the same coordinate plane
  - Create a residual plot to compare the two models
  - Is there a correlation between the two models? Is the residual plot white noise?
  - How do we determine the fit between the lines in the plot?


**S.M.A.R.T. Goals**

- [S]pecific
  - Create graph outputs for ETAS and Alarm Data based on the data provided by the analyzers
  - Overlay two graphs on the same coordinate plane and compare
  - Create a residual plot to compare the two models & determine if it is white noise
  - Look for a correlation b/w the two models
- [M]easurable
  - (*note* all of this should be available after receiving the relevant data from analyzers)
  - The data for each model will be measurable by its parameters and axes
  - The fitness of the lines should be measurable (should come up with a way)
  - If any, the correlation between the 2 models should be measurable
- [A]ttainable
  - Contact analyzer groups to attain the data for visualization
  - Our output is not attainable yet. 
- [R]elevant
  - We thought it is a relevant idea to reach out for Brad Luen by identifying his current contact information and ask about - MDA model; -> We found that one of the vertical groups has already done so and supposedly got a reply back, which we should inquire them for.
  - Will reach out for other visualizers to get a better picture of visualization of this project as a whole
- [T]ime bound
  - By Sunday 10PM: post rough draft for SMART goals
  - By Monday 11:59PM: post SMART goals; have an understanding of how our group fits into the big picture; get into contact with the other groups 
  - Most of our timeline is dependent on the timelines of the other groups (such as the analyzers)


**ROADBLOCKS**

- Difficulty in communicating with others 
 - To solve this, we tried contacting other groups using Github, Facebook, and office hours
 - Our presenter met up with other presenters, and through this we were able to understand what the other groups are doing
 - Visualizers created a Facebook group and tried to reorganize ourselves, following the analyzers' examples on Github
- Late group organization
 - Because of this, we met up with each other twice, and kept in frequent contact via Facebook, Github, and phone apps
 - Created a common Github issue tracker to organize our SMART goals (This one!)
